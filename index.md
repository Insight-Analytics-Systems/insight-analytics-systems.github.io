Systematic Equity Momentum Signals
for Investors with Sufficient Capital
A rules-based, long-only US equity momentum strategy designed to participate in equity uptrends while historically avoiding catastrophic drawdowns relative to a fully invested S&P 500.
Minimum recommended capital: $30,000+

What this is
This service provides systematic portfolio signals derived from a quantitative equity momentum model.
    • Long-only US equities
    • Fully rules-based
    • No discretion
    • No personalization
    • Signals, not advice
The objective is disciplined equity exposure, implemented consistently over time.

What this is not
    • Not investment advice
    • Not discretionary trading
    • Not a get-rich-quick product
    • Not suitable for small accounts
    • Not designed for short-term trading
This is a process-driven system intended for investors who accept drawdowns as part of long-term participation in equity markets.

Risk and drawdowns (read this carefully)
All equity strategies experience drawdowns.
Historically, the model experienced a maximum drawdown of approximately −24%, compared to approximately −55% for a fully invested S&P 500 over the same period.
Future drawdowns may be larger than those observed historically.
This service does not aim to eliminate losses.
It aims to manage equity exposure systematically, without emotional decision-making.

Who this is for
    • Investors who prefer rules over opinions
    • Investors who value process and discipline
    • Investors who can tolerate temporary losses
    • Investors with sufficient capital to diversify properly

Who this is not for
    • Accounts below the recommended capital threshold
    • Investors seeking constant action or frequent trades
    • Investors unwilling to accept drawdowns
    • Investors looking for personalized advice
If this description feels restrictive, this service is likely not appropriate.

How it works (high level)
    • A diversified basket of US equities is selected based on momentum criteria
    • Portfolio weights are determined by predefined rules
    • Rebalancing occurs at fixed intervals
    • All signals are time-stamped and rule-driven
No discretionary overrides are applied.
